# Results

## Experimental Setup
We use the OpenSky ADS-B states snapshot (states_2022-06-27-23.csv) to extract arrival/departure events near the inferred airport location. We compare AGNO-RS against FCFS, MILP (baseline only), and GA baselines using total delay, average delay, makespan, and throughput.

## Quantitative Results
| Method | Total Delay | Avg Delay | Makespan | Throughput |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| AGNO-RS | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| FCFS | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| MILP | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| GA | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |

## Qualitative Figures
- Figure 1: Gantt chart of runway usage (AGNO-RS).
- Figure 2: Delay distribution across methods.
- Figure 3: Throughput over time.

## Discussion
AGNO-RS yields lower aggregate delay with improved throughput, while maintaining safety constraints. The graph representation captures interference patterns absent in linear or heuristic baselines.
